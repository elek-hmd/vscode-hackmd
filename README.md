## We will fix HackMD VSCode extension logging-in issue
Users have been unable to log in to the VSCode extension. We apologize for your hampered workflow.

The logging-in of our VSCode extension broke since we've introduced several measures into the logging-in flow to ward off bot registrations and other spam. 

We will fix this in 2ï½ž3 weeks. Instead of email and password, you will use an API token for logging in to the extension in the future.

We could have avoided this issue and have learned a lesson. We apologize for the inconvenience you might experience.
